        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Anny Jiang and I am currently a pre-business major with a concentration in marketing. My career goal in the future is to go into the advertising industry and hopefully be able to go work at an advertising firm. I have always enjoyed watching commercials on television and wondered what the process of creating a commercial would be like. I often enjoy looking at ads on newspapers, social media, and billboards. I am also very interested in working in entertainment, such as becoming a professional screenwriter for commercials and ads. <br><br>

        In high school, I participated in a variety of clubs and extracurricular activities. I was a part of my schoolâ€™s newspaper, The Aztec, for three years, serving two years as the Viewpoint Editor and photographer. I edited viewpoint pieces and created layouts for the newspaper every month, as well as took pictures of major events that happened around school. I was also part of my schoolâ€™s tennis team for three years. In tennis, I learned the importance of teamwork and patience. In addition to tennis and the newspaper, I was a member of the California Scholarship Federation and Math Club for four years. In my four years of high school, I had perfect attendance and received the bilingual seal on my diploma. In my senior year of high school, I was an office intern for my schoolâ€™s Business and Activities Office. I worked with the Vice Principal and the office manager. My duties included organizing and filing documents into binders, putting up and taking down posters from all around school, helping students with their locker problems, and answering the phone when the Vice Principal and office manager is not present in the room. This fellowship really helped me gain experience in what it is like to work in a busy office; in addition, my communication and confidence when talking to adults have increased. In college, I have joined clubs such as Chinese Student Association (CSA) and Student Alumni Association (SAA). In Chinese Student Association, I am part of the top four families: Raging Bunnies. In that family, the members of the club bond over watching shows / dramas and playing board, card, and video games. I am a general member of the Student Alumni Association, but I did apply to a part of the SAA Board of Directors. Being a part of the Board of Directors would really help me gain experience as a business major. The concentration I plan on concentrating in is marketing and getting into the marketing board would really teach me the basics of marketing. This way, I would have experience in this field and potentially network with alumni who are in the same field as me. 
 <br><br>

        My interests include watching television shows / korean and chinese dramas, listening to music, and eating good food. My hobbies include playing tennis, collecting mugs, reading novels and webtoons, photography, traveling, and driving. I enjoy rainy days and winter nights instead of sunny summer days. I also like strolling around at night, while looking up at the clear night sky searching for beautiful, bright stars.
